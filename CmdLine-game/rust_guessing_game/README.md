## Description:

Code Copilot: Command-Line Game is a project where I built a simple command-line game with the help of Copilot, using the Rust programming language. The game is a guessing game where players try to guess a randomly generated number. Copilot assisted me in navigating the unfamiliar syntax and coding patterns of Rust, making it possible for me to create the game from scratch.

### Features:

Simple command-line interface
Randomly generated numbers for each game session
Players can input their guesses and receive feedback on whether they are too small, too big, or correct
Continuously loops until the player guesses the correct number

### Built With:

Rust programming language
Cargo package manager
Visual Studio Code as the development environment
Copilot AI assistance

### How to Run:

Make sure Rust and Cargo are installed on your system.
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
Run the command cargo run to compile and execute the game.
Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.
